This code is developed around the core needs of quantum computing hardware, focusing on providing a comprehensive pulse sequence optimization solution for 2-qubit and 3-qubit quantum computing systems. Its core functions cover two key modules: First, it designs adaptive pulse sequence optimization algorithms respectively for the coupling characteristics between 2-qubit systems and the multi-qubit cooperative control logic of 3-qubit quantum systems. By precisely adjusting the amplitude, duration, phase, and timing relationship of pulses, it effectively reduces decoherence errors in quantum operations and improves the fidelity of quantum gates. Second, it builds an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) based on the PyQt5 framework. The interface integrates a parameter configuration area (for inputting key parameters such as resonance frequency, pulse width, and temperature coefficient), a pulse type selection area (supporting the selection of multiple pulse types including single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates), a real-time log display area (dynamically feeding back pulse generation progress and fidelity data), and an output setting area. Users can complete the entire process from parameter configuration to pulse generation through visual operations without writing code. In terms of output functions, the code supports generating files in two mainstream formats: one is the spinq format file adapted to the hardware control requirements of SpinQ's quantum computers, which can be directly imported into the device control system to execute quantum operations; the other is the json format file that facilitates data storage and secondary analysis, which can record detailed parameters of the pulse sequence (such as pulse ID, fidelity, duration, etc.) and provide data support for subsequent algorithm optimization and experimental reproduction. Overall, this code realizes a closed loop of "algorithm optimization - visual operation - hardware-adapted output", aiming to provide users of SpinQ's quantum computers with an efficient and convenient pulse sequence generation tool, lower the technical threshold of quantum experiments, and contribute to the advancement of quantum computing-related research and applications.
